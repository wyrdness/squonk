      "full": "The Squonk is a fearsome critter from Pennsylvania lumberjack folklore, notable for being the saddest and most tragic of all fearsome critters. Described as having hideously warty, saggy skin, the Squonk is so ashamed of its appearance that it weeps perpetually while wandering hemlock forests. According to the tales, if a Squonk is captured or even observed, it dissolves completely into a pool of tears, escaping as liquid. This makes it impossible to keep as proof. The Squonk represents an unusual entry in fearsome critter folklore - a creature evoking sympathy rather than fear. It has gained cultural recognition beyond folklore, including a 1976 Genesis song titled 'Squonk.'"
